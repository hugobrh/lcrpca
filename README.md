# lcrpca
Repository containing code to replicate LCRPCA unrolling network in "Deep unrolling of Robust PCA and Convolutional Sparse Coding for stationary target localization in through wall radar imaging" ,EUSIPCO 2024

Code inspired by:

Corona : https://github.com/KrakenLeaf/CORONA

LCSC : https://github.com/benMen87/ApproximateConvolutionalSparseCoding

The repo does not include a dataset. The file `gprmax_dataset_creation.py` contains the code to create one. Some directory paths should be ajusted.
